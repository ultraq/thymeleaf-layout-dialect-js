Still under development
-----------------------

This project is still under development.  Current goals include:

 - working in tandem with 2.x of the layout dialect (the Thymeleaf 3 branch)
 - process the `decorate` and `fragment` directives first to get overall
   layouts working
 - start by working using http on localhost (ie: work on the `file:///` problem
   later)
